# panoply

A language designed to test out ideas I think are neat and worth exploring more.
This is not necessarily a simple or good language, but more an arrangement of ideas I wanted to flesh out some more and think might combine to produce a splendid arrangement.

The big ideas of the language are:

  * Structural typing (based on [Abstracting Extensible Datatypes](https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jgmorrs/pubs/morris-popl2019-rows.pdf) series of papers)
  * Algebraic Effects in the style of [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) ([Generalized Evidence Passing for Effect Handlers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2021/08/genev-icfp21.pdf))
  * Strong Mixin Modules ([Mixin' Up the ML Module System](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/papers/Dreyer,%20Rossberg%20-%20Mixin'%20Up%20the%20ML%20Module%20System.pdf))
  * Local coherent implicits (based on [COCHIS](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~bruno/papers/JFPImplicits.pdf))
